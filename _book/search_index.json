After all, multiome or scATAC-seq data is still relatively rare. To enable TF activity inference on scRNA-seq, users can supply a pre-constructed gene regulatory network. Dorothea provides both human and mouse pre-constructed gene regulatory networks based on curated experimental and computational data. In this vignette, we bypass the regulon construction step and go straight to calculate TF activity from a Dorothea GRN. 6.1 Load regulon Dorothea assigns confidence level to its regulons with A being the most confident (i.e. supported by multiple lines of evidence) and E being the least confident. library(dorothea) data(dorothea_mm, package = &quot;dorothea&quot;) regulon &lt;- dorothea_mm #known tfs genes_to_plot &lt;- c(&quot;Foxa1&quot;, &quot;Neurod1&quot;,&quot;Pdx1&quot;,&quot;Arx&quot;) 6.2 Load scRNA-seq data We download the raw counts of a mouse pancreas data set from scRNAseq. We add normalized logcounts, perform dimension reduction and visualize the embeddings using scater. library(scRNAseq) library(scater) sce &lt;- BaronPancreasData(&#39;mouse&#39;) sce &lt;- logNormCounts(sce) sce &lt;- runPCA(sce) sce &lt;- runUMAP(sce) plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &quot;label&quot;, text_by = &quot;label&quot;) 6.3 Calculate activity Even though Dorothea provides weights under the mor column, we achieved superior performance if we recompute the weights based on the correlation between tf and target gene expression based on our own data. We performed 2 steps, the first step is to add weights to the Dorothea regulons and the second step is to estimate the TF activity by taking the weighted average of the target gene expression. library(epiregulon) #Add weights to regulon regulon.ms &lt;- addWeights(regulon = regulon, expMatrix = sce, clusters = sce$label, BPPARAM = BiocParallel::MulticoreParam()) #Calculate activity score.combine &lt;- calculateActivity(sce, regulon = regulon.ms, mode = &quot;weight&quot;, method = &quot;weightedMean&quot;) 6.4 Perform differential activity markers &lt;- findDifferentialActivity(activity_matrix = score.combine, groups = sce$label, pval.type = &quot;some&quot;, direction = &quot;up&quot;, test.type = &quot;t&quot;) ## Warning: The `groups` argument of `findDifferentialActivity()` is deprecated as of ## epiregulon 1.0.0. ## ℹ Please use the `clusters` argument instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was ## generated.

We confirm the activity of known lineage factors Pdx1 and Neurod1 in beta cells, Arx in alpha cells and Foxa1 in ductal cells. # plot umap plotActivityDim(sce = sce, activity_matrix = score.combine, tf = genes_to_plot, legend.label = &quot;score&quot;, point_size = 0.1, dimtype = &quot;UMAP&quot;, label = &quot;label&quot;, combine = TRUE, text_size = 2) # plot violin plot plotActivityViolin(score.combine, tf = genes_to_plot, clusters = sce$label) # plot bubble plot plotBubble(score.combine, tf = genes_to_plot, clusters = sce$label) Plot bubble plot of differential TFs plotBubble(score.combine, tf = markers.sig$tf, clusters = sce$label) We can adapt the epiregulon package to plot gene expression. When compared against TF activity, gene expression of Foxa1 and Arx has noisy signals and high dropout rates. Epiregulon enhances the signal to noise ratio of TF activity and better resolves lineage differences. # plot umap plotActivityDim(sce = sce, activity_matrix = logcounts(sce), tf = genes_to_plot, legend.label = &quot;score&quot;, point_size = 0.1, dimtype = &quot;UMAP&quot;, label = &quot;label&quot;, combine = TRUE, text_size = 2, colors = c(&quot;gray&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;), limit = c(0,2)) # plot violin plot plotActivityViolin(logcounts(sce), tf = genes_to_plot, clusters = sce$label) # plot Bubble plot plotBubble(logcounts(sce), tf = markers.sig$tf, clusters = sce$label) We can visualize the target genes for transcription factors of interest plotHeatmapRegulon(sce=sce, tfs=genes_to_plot, regulon=regulon.ms, regulon_cutoff=0.5, downsample=1000, cell_attributes=&quot;label&quot;, col_gap=&quot;label&quot;, exprs_values=&quot;logcounts&quot;, name=&quot;regulon heatmap&quot;, column_title_rot = 45) plotHeatmapActivity(activity_matrix = score.combine, sce=sce, tfs=genes_to_plot, downsample=1000, cell_attributes=&quot;label&quot;, col_gap=&quot;label&quot;, name=&quot;regulon heatmap&quot;, column_title_rot = 45) ## Pathway enrichment Sometimes it is useful to understand what pathways are enriched in the regulons.
